Hello everyone! Thanks for stopping by! So, what is this blog about?

The main focus of this blog will be on *Software Quality*. When we say
Software Quality, we're talking about everything that a team can do
from conception to maintenance to improve the end product. It's 
important to us that this is not just about "QA", or "testing";
everyone has roles to play to bring a software project to a happy end.

<!-- more -->

This blog is actually written by two people: one with lots of QA
experience, and one with lots of development experience! And even
better, we both have opinions about what the other should be doing!
(Is this a blog or sitcom?)

When we talk about software quality, we'll be asking all kinds of 
questions:

1. What is it?
2. How can we generate it?
3. How can we judge it?
4. Why does it even matter?
5. This is all on those QA guys, right?

We've got lots of topics already lined up, and based on feedback
we wil love to meander where you lead us. We will be posting every
Tuesday and Thursday, like clockwork.

Now let us introduce ourselves:

Hey everyone, this is Chris! I picked up programming as a hobby a
long time ago, and eventually made a career out of it. I'm always
looking for a better way of doing things, with a <strike>little</strike> lot of help
from others showing me the way. I spend most of my time working with
C# and C++, but more and more with JS, Ruby, and Python. I also love
reading books about how to better execute software projects, suggestions
always welcome!


Next Tuesday: Does your team care about quality? Actions speak louder than words.
