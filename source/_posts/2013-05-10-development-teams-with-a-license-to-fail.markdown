For most of this series I am going to concentrate on what practices separate low quality and high quality development teams, but before we get there we might as well talk about the *worst*.

You might know this guy. Imagine a team of them.

Someone tells the developers to do something. The requirements are vague, maybe nonexistent. Whatever.

The developers throw some code together. Once its written, they copy it over to production. Then they probably go home for the day. (Look, I'm being optimistic! They didn't write the code directly in production!) 

The next morning they'll get into the office to find that either 

1. production is horribly broken and/or 
2. it isn't what the customer wanted in the first place and/or 
3. writing the next feature is becoming increasingly hard 

The rest of the organization steadily loses faith in the development team, and whatever team morale there was in the first place is heading for the door. Look, all kinds of bad things can happen. 


But Why??
=========

This (hopefully) theoretical team does not care about quality. Maybe the business is pushing for a hopeless deadline, and everyone thinks the only way to get there is to ditch as much "process" as possible. Maybe the team just doesn't know better ways of doing things. Maybe they do know of them, but think their cost outweighs the benefits. Maybe they think the product is already so far from grace that the most they can hope for is keeping it from derailing.

Hopefully this doesn't remind you of a team you know (or are a part of).
